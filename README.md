# Optimizing LLMs

### Purpose

Accompanying code for [Shaan](https://hihello.me/p/36e30603-568b-481e-aad5-7001c0f42533)'s 3-hour live [training](https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/optimizing-large-language-models/0636920090981/0636920090980) offered on O'Reilly on July 20th, 2023. 

The "repo art" was generated by Research Assistant [Noah Ari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-ari/) using a checkpoint called [ayonimixv6](https://civitai.com/models/4550/ayonimix) from the [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/) checkpoint sharing website. These are some artistic takes on "Optimizing LLMs" in which the description for the class was used as the prompt.
